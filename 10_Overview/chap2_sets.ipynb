    "### Introduction to Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are collections of objects (without repetitions). Set theory dates back to the great German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918) and forms the foundation of modern mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe a set by listing all its elements explicitly, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M := \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "defines a set $M$. It is convention to use capital letters (e.g., A, B, C) to represent sets. The objects in a set are called elements and are represented by lower case letters (e.g., x, y, z). \n",
    "\n",
    "* We say $x$ is an element in $X$, or short $x\\in X$, if $x$ is contained in the set $X$. \n",
    "* Otherwise we say that $x$ is not an element of $X$, or short $x\\not\\in X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example 2 is an element in $M$, i.e., $2\\in M$. In contrast, 7 is not an element in $M$, i.e., $7\\not\\in M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our set $M$ contains 6 elements. We also say that the set $M$ has a cardinality of 6 and we can express this concisely as $|M|=6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a set is not infinite, then the cardinality of a set is a measure of the \"number of elements\" of the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, here we use the logical symbol $:=$ to define $M$ as an object that is equal to the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. In contrast, the symbol $=$ expresses that the object on the left side is equal to the object on its right side. We will often be a bit sloppy and simply use $=$ to define a set, but it is good to keep in mind that there can be a difference between a definition and an equality. This is in particular import when we are writing code, e.g., `x=5` assigns the value 5 to `x` and this is different from the logical operation `x==5` which compares whether `x` is equal to 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define an infinite set, i.e., a set that has no last element as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{N}^* := \\{1,2,3,...\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This set contains all positive integers, i.e., it is the set of all natural numbers without 0. (We call $\\{\\}$ the set brackets, and the dots $...$ are called ellipsis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations it would be tedious to list all elements. But, we can also define sets by stating properties that characterize its members. For example we can define $M$ more concisely as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M := \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}^* | x\\le 6\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we say that the element $x$ is a member of $\\mathbb{N}^*$ such that $x$ is smaller or equal to 6. When we define sets by stating properties we use typically the following notation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\{\\text{membership}|\\text{properties}\\}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "or \n",
