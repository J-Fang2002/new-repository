For example, assume you are asked to categorize a few hundred news paper articles based on the headlines. Of course, you can do this job by hand, but it might be tedious. So let's think about how we can automate this task. \n",

    "* Machine learning is able to learn without human supervision!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can guess that the first and second headline belong to same category, i.e., weather. In order to come up with a quantitative answer, we need to first transform each of these text sequences into a set of ordered numeric values. There are many ways to do so, and a simple method is to count the appearance of each word in the text sequence. First, we need to store the text sequences as strings in a list."
